### Project Title: Automated Deployment of a Simple Web Application

#### Objective:
To set up a basic CI/CD pipeline for deploying a simple web application to a cloud environment. This project assesses the candidate’s understanding of containerization, automation, and cloud deployment basics.

#### Project Requirements:
1. Application Setup:
- Deploy a basic web application, such as a Python Flask or Node.js app, that displays a simple "Hello, World!" message on the home page.
- The app code should be hosted on a GitHub repository or similar version control platform.

2. Containerization:
- Create a Dockerfile to containerize the web application.
- Ensure the container builds successfully and runs locally.

3. CI/CD Pipeline:
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.
- The pipeline should automatically build the Docker image whenever code is pushed to the main branch.
- Add a step to run a basic test (e.g., checking if the app starts correctly or responding with the expected message).

4. Basic Cloud Deployment:
- Deploy the containerized app to a cloud provider’s container service or simple docker engine.
